# PyQt6-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is an incredibly simple game I made in PyQt6 for gui practice. Just download folder, open "Rock Paper Scissors game" folder not "PyQt6-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-main" folder in whatever IDE or Code Editor you have, run the menu.py file and everything should work. Hand assets are not mine, they came from here https://www.dreamstime.com/rock-paper-scissors-hand-gesture-image146405392. I am open to any critique or criticism
